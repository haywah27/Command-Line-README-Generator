# Command Line README Generator

## Description
Using the command line in the integrated terminal, a user can quickly and easily create a README file. This is done using a JavaSCript file containing code for how to handle answers form the user. The questions asked are handled using the Inquirer JSON package. Node is used to invoke the relative JavaScript file. After the questions are answered, fs is used to write a new README.md file, in the repo folder, containing all the provided information.
